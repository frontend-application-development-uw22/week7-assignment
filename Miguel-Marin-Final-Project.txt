Project Name: Digital Diviner

Elevator pitch:

Digital Diviner is a for-fun/entertainment web app that will be used by fans of Harry Potter / Magic / Fantasy enthusiasts. This web app will serve as a sort of interactive spell and potions book that lists all the known spells and potions in the Harry Potter universe including its uses, the incantation and such.

The user will create an account and have access to all the content. Each spell and potion will have a "To Learn" button which users can click and it will add that specific spell/potion to their "To Learn" list 


Dependencies:

-Firebase or similar platform for user authentication
-Spells/Potions JSON Data file


Tasks:

-Setup create-react-app scaffold
-Enable User authentication (user authentication would be a nice to-have, but if it can't be figured put in a timely manner, will need to scrap this part and make it fully open) 
-Call the JSON data file and print results
-Store API results in React component state
-Render
-Add to learn functionality
-Styling
-Deploy

- Week 1: 

Create react app, setup firebase and set up user authentication 

- week 2: 

Work with Json data and style

- Week 3:

continue/finalize styling and deploy
