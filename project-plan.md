## Project Name
* Portfolio Website

## Elevator Pitch
* I'd like to create a simple portfolio website to showcase my skills to audiences, such as, future employers, recruiters and other aspiring developers. Most of the value in this project is for myself since it'll be good practice for me to create something from scratch, and I'd want it to look clean and presentable. I don't think having a portfolio is necessarily a requirement for getting a first dev job, but I think creating one would be a good story in a potential interview. 

## Wireframes
* [Rough layout](./wireframe.PNG)

## Dependencies
* React
* Firebase
* Word API (For possible "Easter Egg")
* Bootstrap

## Week 1 Plan
* Create React app
* Create component files
* Write an "About Me" blurb
* Sign up for API and obtain API key
* Find color scheme
* Gather projects for portfolio
* Write some silly Mad Lib portfolio as Easter Egg with Word API

## Week 2 Plan
* Create routes to each page
* Create form submission for "Contact Me" Page
* Link projects in Git
* Add widgets (weather app, clock app, stock market, images, etc)
* Start working on styling

## Week 3 Plan
* Mostly styling at this point

## Nice to Have
* Host my projects publicly so I can link to them
* ...Have more projects to link...
