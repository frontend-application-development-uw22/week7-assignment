Week 7 Assignment:  Final Project Proposal
Contributors:  Karen Cameron

Project Name:  Online Idea Board (official name to be determined)

Project Description:  The Online Idea Board is focused on users that will want to collect ideas, that is also searchable and if time allows categorized to separate boards.  If time does not allow, categorized boards will be implemented on subsequent versions. This project is inspired by Pinterest which I am an avid user of.  The project will contain a home page, cards for ideas, and a search bar.  Each card will contain an image, title, and description along with a button to let the user delete the idea.  

Wireframe:  Please see the attached.

Dependencies: 
Possible API pulls for images perhaps from Unsplash, etc.
React Router
Bootstrap
Possible Firebase if time allows.

Tasks:
Main Page
Create idea cards
Individual card page
Possible notes or comments features
Add idea button
Delete idea button
CSS formatting of Home page
CSS formatting of cards

Plan:
Week 1:  Develop framework and code fundamental pieces including developing code for the individual ideas in the form of cards as well as the main page, and search bar. Deploy application.
Week 2:  Add and enhance CSS styling to ensure the cards are styled well and polished.
Week 3:  Test and streamline coding.  This week will be used for testing done by potential users and check for issues with adding and removing ideas and addressing any potential issues.
