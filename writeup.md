# New York Times Reader
Project name will be nyt-reader

# Elevator Pitch
Intended audience will be devout NYT readers or disaffected college students that are currently bored with their coursework and just want to kill time, just not on reddit. It seeks to present information in a sleeker mode and in a shorter form, taking advantage of the NYT API.

To simplify the app, we will focus on a few News Desk values:
- Business
- Culture
- Environment
- Science
- Technology

# Wireframes
Please see this [link](wireframes.pdf)

# Dependencies

Currently this all I have in mind. But will try to look for some sort of animation alternatives.

- Barba.js?
